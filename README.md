# IoMT
Internet of Military Things (IoMT) or Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) is a class of Internet of Things for modern battle operations and intelligent warfare.   It refers to the physical components in the Military doman, Embedded with sensors and monitors to track the ongoing processes.  These sensors collect information like Biometrics, Live location, Capture images and process the data etc.
The Main objective of our project is to showcase the upcoming developments in the smart base and battlefield communication.

This involves the basic tracking of ongoing data both on the military base and the battle fields simultaneously.

This data is collected from different segments and branches. Based on the collected information an alert message is sent incase of any emergency.

There are different methods by which the communications happens among the troops and base camps. One such method which is most suitable in an crucial situation is the generation of Morse codes.

Though it is an old process, this gives a better hand when it comes to communication under pressurized situation.

These codes can be generated through dots and dashes and can be embedded onto an wearable device which a soldier or any person for that matter on a battlefield can wear.

To study this technology we have implemented this on a small 4x4 matrix layout keypad .
